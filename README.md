# 1.1 Research Motivation
In a city such as Barcelona there are many people who want to rent a room for a longer period. The question is how owners can entice these people to rent their apartments. People who want to stay in an Airbnb for an extended period may be looking for a room with extra amenities such as a washing machine or a coffee machine. Employees from certain companies who have to work for a couple of weeks in Barcelona might need some extra work space and/or WiFi for example. This study assumes that long term rentals includes apartments with the availability for over a month. People do have some needs in the span of a month. 
## Research question
Which characteristics of an apartment makes a long-term rental more attractive?
## Research method
To collect the required data, all available data of the city Barcelona is downloaded via Inside.Airbnb.com. Because the focus of this study is on one particular city all data is being processed. We will conduct a regression analysis (?) to check which characteristics of an apartment entice customers to book that particular apartment for a long stay (>30 days).
