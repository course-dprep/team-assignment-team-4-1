## Motivation

### Background
[Upcoming digital nomads]
According to research, the number of people working remotely almost doubled between 2019 and 2021. Moreover, in July 2022, remote work listings accounted for 17% of the total listings on LinkedIn (https://www.rentalscaleup.com/airbnbs-advice-and-data-on-how-to-attract-digital-nomads/). Although remote workers don't have a fixed place to live, they do need a place to stay for a certain period of time (usually for around a month or longer). Airbnb is the biggest platform to find long-term stays and is widely used by digital nomads. As Airbnb itself says, that they want to make it easier for guests to live in Airbnb listing with their 'Live anywhere on Airbnb' trial program. At the end of 2021, long-term stays of over 28 nights already accounted for 22% of gross nights booked (https://www.rentalscaleup.com/2022-airbnb-strategy/ ; https://www.airbnbforwork.com/resource/digital-nomads-find-the-perfect-solution-to-work-and-live-remotely-while-traveling-the-globe/ ;

People that want to stay in an Airbnb for an extended period may be looking for a room with certain amenities. For instance, important characteristics include great wifi and some digital nomads say that a seperate bedroom and fully equiped kitchen are important to them. (https://www.desklessnomad.com/remote-worker-guide-living-airbnbs/#:~:text=Airbnb%20is%20a%20great%20way,set%20of%20challenges%20and%20considerations. ; https://www.rentalscaleup.com/airbnbs-advice-and-data-on-how-to-attract-digital-nomads/ ; https://www.airbnbforwork.com/resource/digital-nomads-find-the-perfect-solution-to-work-and-live-remotely-while-traveling-the-globe/). In this research we try to investigate what other characteristics are important for Digital Nomads and how landlords can make their apartments more attractive for these long-term rentals. 


### Research question
In a city such as Barcelona there are many people who want to rent a room for a longer period. The question is how owners can entice these people to rent their apartments. Employees from certain companies who have to work for a couple of weeks in Barcelona might need some extra work space and/or WiFi for example. Therefore, our research questions is:

How does an AirBnb landlord make the apartment more attractive for long-term rentals?
